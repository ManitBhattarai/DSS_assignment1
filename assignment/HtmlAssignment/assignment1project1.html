        <p>
            I am not a very athletic person so I never really took interest in any physical sports. Because of that
            reason,
            I
            became very close to computer related stuff like Programming, Playing games,etc. I also enjoy Movies, TV
            shows
            and Anime (Japanese animated shows). Sometimes, when I have nothing to do I grab a pen and paper and start
            drawing with no goal in mind, I dont know why but it's kind of relaxing to me. But the thing I enjoy doing
            the
            most is Sleeping.

        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <p>
            I graduated from Little Angels' School as 2075 batch after completion of my S.E.E with 3.7 gpa. I enrolled
            in
            Deerwalk Sifal Secondary School to complte my 10 + 2. After graduating from here I plan to further study on
            Computer Engineering. Then get a job at high-paying stable company and start my own company at some
            point.
